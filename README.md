# Linear Regression from Scratch

This project demonstrates the core mathematical logic behind linear regression by building a model from scratch using NumPy.

## Features
- Implements a linear regression model using gradient descent
- Calculates evaluation metrics: MSE, MAE, and RÂ² score
- Predicts salary based on years of experience
- Includes data visualization using matplotlib

## Usage
You can use this for any application where a linear relationship is expected. For example:
- House price prediction
- Salary prediction based on work experience
- Any dataset suitable for simple linear regression
